## About Me

I am a **Cyber Security Engineer** and **Cloud Architect** focused on operational defense, client security architecture, and long-term risk reduction.

At work (MSP), I focus on:
- **Security Incident Response**: triage, containment, recovery, and lessons learned.
- **Cybersecurity Stack Architecture**: planning and designing layered controls across diverse client environments.
- **Automation & AI Engineering**: in-house scripting and development of monitoring automations and custom security solutions.
- **Audit & Compliance Execution**: working directly with auditors and evidence workflows.
- **Pentest Remediation**: prioritizing and closing findings with measurable risk reduction.
- **Security Roadmaps**: strategy, architecture, deployment, and implementation of security initiatives.
- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**: governance design, control mapping, policy uplift, and risk tracking.
- **Framework Alignment**: ISO 27001, CIS Controls, Essential Eight, and core blue-team operations.
- **Networking & Protocol Analysis**: extensive networking experience with deep-dive protocol work across TLS, SSL, DNS, and related controls.

## Current Focus

Outside of work, I am building **agentic AI solutions** for security, including agents capable of reverse engineering and analyzing files, systems, programs, and binaries.

I am also building a **browser extension** to detect both MITM proxy phishing pages and generic phishing sites by combining:
- browser heuristics,
- CSP, DOM, and CSS signals,
- domain and TLS intelligence,
- and ML-driven classification to block malicious destinations in real time.
